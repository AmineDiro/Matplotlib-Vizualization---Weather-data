Broken decade highlow temperatures in 2015

## Dataset Visualization 

We first plotted a linegraph of the recoprds high and low temperatures by day of the year over the 2005 - 2014 period.

The datasat used is a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Daily Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN-Daily). The GHCN-Daily is comprised of daily climate records from thousands of land surface stations across the globe.

Then we layed over points of high and low in 2015 specifically

## Analysis

1.  We see clearly that temperatures are droping below the decade low at the start of 2015 and rising above the decade high consistently throughout 2015
